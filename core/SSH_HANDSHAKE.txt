    - SELF NOTE

Every part form the 4 part of the SSH Handshake is by itself an Algorithm
therefore we have:
    1/Key Exchange (KEX)
    2/Symmetric Cipher
    3/Message Authentication Code (MAC)
    4/Server Host Key Algorithm

        1/ is Shared secret from both client/server that they agree on ( Algorithm that creates keys )

        2/ is an encryption method for the communication ( Algorithm that encrypts )

        3/ is an integrity checker with HASH ( Algorithm that verifies )

        4/ The main Cryptographic method to be used ( rsa ) - which proves host Key identity

     Downgrade is possible if what is offered ( KEX, Cipher, MAC ) is weak
